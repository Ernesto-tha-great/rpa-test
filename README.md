Submission of test for frontier junior backend role
I could not use typescript as i was not familiar with it. Though, i have started learning it.
I also had to learn puppeteer to be able to do this project and i must admit, it was quite intriguing. I am grateful for thqat experience.
This is my own submission for the task given. It took me two days to familiarize myself with puppeteer and a day to write this project. 
This project opens up a browser and navigates to the job application page for frontier and auto-fills all the required value. I tried getting it to also submit automatically but i could not.
My thought on the exercise? It was challenging and gave me the opportunity to learn new technologies. but then, requirements are not really explicit. some areas are vague.
